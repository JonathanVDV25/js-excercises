# js-excercises from Jonathan Van de Vyver

## Description
Here is my repo of JS. You'll find all the exercices I did for JS.

## Install and run project
- clone the frontend git repository in this folder
```shell
git clone [repo-name]
```
- install node in both of these repos
```shell
npm i
```
- and the final step is to start the project in both repos
```shell
npm start
```
